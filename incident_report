Section 1: Identify the type of attack that may have caused this network interruption:

One potential explanation for the website's connection timeout error message is:
The web server may be experiencing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.

The logs show that:
There is a large number of TCP SYN requests coming from an unfamiliar IP address.

This event could be:
A SYN flood attack, a type of DDoS attack where an attacker overwhelms the target server with a massive volume of TCP SYN requests.

Section 2: Explain how the attack is causing the website to malfunction:

When website visitors try to establish a connection with the web server, a three-way handshake occurs using the TCP protocol:

SYN (Synchronize): The client sends a SYN packet to the server, indicating an intent to establish a connection.

SYN-ACK (Synchronize-Acknowledge): The server responds with a SYN-ACK packet, acknowledging the request and indicating its readiness to establish a connection.

ACK (Acknowledge): The client sends an ACK packet back to the server, confirming the connection.

In a normal scenario, this process allows for a reliable and orderly establishment of a connection. However, in a SYN flood attack:

Explanation of a SYN flood attack:
A malicious actor floods the target server with a large number of SYN packets, but either does not respond to the SYN-ACK packets from the server or spoofs the source IP addresses. This causes the server to keep waiting for the final ACK that never arrives, tying up resources and preventing legitimate connections from being established.

Explanation of the impact on the server:
The logs indicate an abnormal number of incoming SYN requests, suggesting that the server's resources are being overwhelmed. The server is unable to differentiate between legitimate and malicious connection requests, leading to a state where it cannot respond effectively. As a result, the server is unable to establish connections with legitimate users, leading to the observed connection timeout errors.

Immediate Actions Taken:

The server was taken offline temporarily to allow it to recover and return to normal operation.
The company's firewall was configured to block the IP address responsible for the abnormal SYN requests.
Next Steps:

The current IP blocking solution is acknowledged as temporary, and the possibility of IP address spoofing is recognized. Further measures such as rate limiting, traffic filtering, and potentially engaging with the ISP for assistance should be considered.
Investigation into the source of the attack and potential motives.
Enhancing server and network infrastructure to better withstand and mitigate DDoS attacks in the future.
Ongoing monitoring and alerting systems to detect and respond to similar incidents promptly.
